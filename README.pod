=head1 NAME

X11::Wallpaper - set X11 wallpaper using best available helper program

=head1 VERSION

version 1.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use X11::Wallpaper qw(set_wallpaper);
  set_wallpaper( "./foo.jpg", {
    mode => 'full',   # default, or: aspect, center, tile
    setter => 'feh',  # override setter
    display => ':0.0' # override X display
  } );

  my @cmd = set_wallaper_command(...); # just give me the command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface for setting the background on X11
systems, by recruiting a suitable helper script (feh, Esetroot, hsetroot,
chbg, xli etc.) and providing appropriate options.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 set_wallpaper($image_path, %args)

Sets C<$image_path> as the desktop wallpaper. The following args are
supported:

=over

=item mode

May be 'full' (fullscreen, stretched to fit - the default), 'tile',
'center' (do not stretch) or 'aspect' (fullscreen, preserving
aspect ratio). For the latter two options, the background for any
borders around the image is set to black.

=item setter

Manually specify the program to use, e.g. 'qiv', provided it is
in this module's dictionary of commands.

=item display

Override the X display to use, e.g. ':0.0'. Otherwise defaults to
the value of the DISPLAY environment variable.

=back

=head2 @cmd = set_wallpaper_command($image_path, %args)

As with C<set_wallpaper>, except returns the command (as a list of
arguments) instead of executing it.

=head1 CREDITS

Inspired by the C<awsetbg> shell script by Julian Danjou, which in turn
is derived from C<fbsetbg> by Han Boetes.

=head1 TODO

Skip the middle man and code against the X11 libraries directly. But
that wouldn't be quite as portable...
